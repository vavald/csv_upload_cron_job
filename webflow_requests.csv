She is part of a small marketing team, and today, her main focus is on creating a new landing page for an upcoming product launch. The pressure is on, as the team is constantly bottlenecked by the number of landing pages they need to produce. Jenna opens Webflow, hoping to quickly spin up a page, but the process is slow and cumbersome. She finds herself spending hours manually designing layouts and crafting copy, wishing there was a more efficient way to get the job done. The frustration builds as she realizes that the time spent on these tasks could be better used for customer acquisition and strategic planning.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, Jenna&apos;s stress levels rise. She juggles between meetings and the painstaking task of building content-heavy landing pages. The lack of an AI-powered tool to assist with layout and copy generation becomes increasingly apparent. Jenna imagines how much easier her day would be if she could simply input a product description or campaign goal and have an AI draft a full landing page. The thought of saving hours per campaign is tantalizing, yet the reality is far from it. As the evening approaches, Jenna feels drained and overwhelmed, knowing that tomorrow will bring the same challenges unless a solution is found. The need for an AI page generation feature in Webflow becomes more urgent with each passing day, as it promises to transform her workflow and alleviate the constant pressure she faces.Release Note: AI Page Generation</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Introducing a revolutionary leap in web design with Webflow&apos;s new <strong>AI Page Generation</strong> feature!

Today, the top priority is addressing a client&apos;s request to <strong>migrate their website from Webflow to another hosting service</strong> due to budget constraints. As Alex dives into the project, the challenges become apparent.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Alex quickly realizes that the process is not as straightforward as it was with previous platforms like WordPress. The <strong>fear of vendor lock-in</strong> looms large, as Alex knows that moving a site from Webflow&apos;s hosting is <em>tricky and time-consuming</em>. The thought of having to <strong>rebuild the entire website</strong> from scratch is daunting, and the potential for wasted time and increased frustration is high.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, Alex&apos;s frustration grows. The inability to simply &apos;move servers&apos; as was possible with legacy systems becomes a significant pain point. The realization that using Webflow&apos;s backend database for products means being tethered to their ecosystem adds to the stress. Alex knows that exporting data as a CSV file is an option, but it&apos;s not a seamless solution.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">By the end of the day, Alex is left feeling overwhelmed and concerned about the <strong>lost revenue</strong> and <strong>client dissatisfaction</strong> that could result from these challenges. The struggle with vendor lock-in is a constant reminder of the limitations faced when using Webflow, and it highlights the need for a more flexible solution.</p><h1>Pain-to-Feature Generator</h1><h2>Feature Name: Exportable Design Package</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Benefit:</strong> Enables seamless migration of website designs to other platforms.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Solution Fit:</strong> Provides users with the ability to export their entire website design, including styles and components, into a standardized format that can be imported into other web design tools.</p><h2>Feature Name: Hosting Flexibility Options</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Benefit:</strong> Offers users the choice to host their websites on alternative platforms without losing functionality.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Solution Fit:</strong> Introduces a feature that allows users to decouple Webflow&apos;s hosting services from its design tools, enabling them to export and host their sites elsewhere while maintaining full design integrity.</p><h2>Feature Name: Data Portability Toolkit</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Benefit:</strong> Facilitates the transfer of backend data to other hosting services.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Solution Fit:</strong> Develops a toolkit that allows users to export their backend data, including CMS collections and e-commerce databases, in a format that can be easily imported into other platforms, ensuring data continuity and flexibility.</p></div></section>",,,USER_VALIDATED,To do,https://product.cycle.app/app/webflow/doc/RG9jX2Q2NzUwM2UzLTdjMmQtNDkxYi04OWQyLTgxN2UyNjY1YzdiNA==,CYCLE,,,,,,,,,,,5,,,,alexander@cycle.app,2025-03-27T23:50:24.300Z,,,,,Designer Tools & Features

This capability is particularly appreciated as it allows users to save time and resources by eliminating the need for a large team or extensive programming knowledge.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Webflow&apos;s user-friendly interface is praised for allowing easy changes and site customization, which is often contrasted with other platforms like Squarespace that require coding for similar flexibility. The platform&apos;s no-code design approach is seen as a significant advantage, providing decent abstractions for design and enabling users to build visually while managing content without developer intervention.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">From a front-end developer&apos;s perspective, Webflow effectively covers backend functionalities and follows a logic similar to coding but in a visual manner. This makes it accessible for marketers and creative departments to control website design and functionality without relying on developers, even for advanced builds.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Webflow&apos;s ability to create and animate without frontend development skills is highlighted, with users appreciating the control over design at every breakpoint. The platform is also noted for allowing the creation and reuse of classes and components with properties intact, akin to a real codebase.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Overall, Webflow is celebrated for solving the problem of needing to rely on developers for visually appealing and functional websites, empowering marketers to act as developers and eliminating the need for external developer assistance. This positions Webflow as a superior alternative to platforms like WordPress, offering innovative site functions and interactions without the complexity of acquiring or coding plugins.</p></div></section>",,,USER_VALIDATED,To do,https://product.cycle.app/app/webflow/doc/RG9jX2IxZGI3MGNhLTRmNDktNGM4Zi05YjkwLTgzYmQ4ZmFjNDQwYg==,CYCLE,,,,,,,,,,,19,,,,alexander@cycle.app,2025-03-27T23:48:59.251Z,,,,,Interactions

50788be2-a9a7-4b4c-a3fa-6083d11ee7c7,2484,Problem,Site Publishing Efficiency Issues,"<section data-type=""summary""><div><h1>A day in the life of a struggling customer</h1><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the sun rises, the designer begins their day with a fresh cup of coffee, ready to dive into the world of web design using Webflow. The morning starts with enthusiasm, as they open their project to make some much-needed updates to a client&apos;s website. However, the excitement quickly fades as they realize the daunting task ahead. The requirement to publish the entire site, rather than just individual changes, looms over them like a dark cloud. With multiple team members working on different sections, the fear of inadvertently publishing unfinished drafts adds a layer of stress. The designer feels trapped, knowing that any attempt to publish could lead to data loss or disrupt the workflow of their colleagues.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, the frustration mounts. The designer juggles between editing pages and waiting for the platform to catch up, as delays in publishing become a constant source of irritation. The inability to publish changes on a single page without affecting others becomes a significant roadblock, especially when working on a large-scale project with over 50 pages. By the afternoon, the designer&apos;s patience is wearing thin. The cumbersome process of deploying to Webflow hosting feels anything but robust, and the frequent crashes in editor mode only add to the chaos.

","<section data-type=""summary""><div><h1>A day in the life of a struggling customer</h1><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the sun rises, our customer begins their day with a fresh cup of coffee, ready to dive into the world of web design using Webflow. They open the platform, eager to make some quick updates to a client&apos;s website. However, the morning enthusiasm quickly wanes as they encounter the first hurdle: editing the main banner. The process is not as straightforward as they had hoped, and the editor&apos;s limitations become apparent. Frustration builds as they struggle to navigate the properties on the right side, which seem confusing and not as intuitive as they would like. The inability to scroll while in designer mode adds to the morning&apos;s challenges, making what should be a simple task feel cumbersome and time-consuming.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, the customer finds themselves wrestling with the editor&apos;s quirks. The afternoon is spent trying to apply animations to specific elements, but the process is not immediately obvious, leading to trial and error. The drag-and-drop functionality, which should simplify layout adjustments, instead becomes a source of irritation as positioning issues arise, requiring manual CSS adjustments. By evening, the customer is weary from the constant battle with the editor&apos;s clunky interface. The fear of inadvertently altering class attributes that might impact other parts of the website looms large, adding a layer of anxiety to their work. As they close their laptop for the day, the sense of accomplishment is overshadowed by the lingering frustration of a tool that feels more like an obstacle than an ally in their creative process.</p><h1>Pain-to-Feature</h1><h2>Identified Problems</h2><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Difficulty editing certain elements, such as the main banner and background images.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Limited usability of the Editor, making it challenging for clients to edit and create content.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Confusing properties panel on the right side.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Glitches and display issues, including loss of changes and problems when copying templates.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Clumsy and unintuitive code editor.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Confusion when using classes that affect multiple pages.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Non-intuitive animation application process.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Difficulty in identifying the current page being edited.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Challenges with drag-and-drop layouts and positioning.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Buggy CMS and editor, causing client tensions.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Cumbersome handling of divs and containers.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Issues with text editing functionality, font sizes, and spacing.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Slow code editing on single pages.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Small text and drag-and-drop functionality concerns.</p></li></ul><h2>Proposed Features</h2><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Enhanced Element Editing:</strong> Improve the ease of editing elements like banners and background images.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Client-Friendly Editor:</strong> Develop a more intuitive and flexible client editor to facilitate content creation and editing.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Streamlined Properties Panel:</strong> Simplify and clarify the properties panel for better usability.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Stability Improvements:</strong> Address glitches and display issues to prevent loss of changes and ensure smooth template copying.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Intuitive Code Editor:</strong> Redesign the code editor for a more user-friendly experience.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Class Management Enhancements:</strong> Provide clearer guidance on class usage to prevent unintended changes across pages.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Animation Application Guidance:</strong> Offer intuitive instructions for applying animations to specific elements.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Page Identification Tools:</strong> Implement features to easily identify the current page being edited.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Improved Drag-and-Drop Functionality:</strong> Enhance the drag-and-drop interface for more accurate positioning.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>CMS and Editor Reliability:</strong> Increase the reliability of the CMS and editor to reduce client frustrations.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Efficient Div and Container Management:</strong> Simplify the process of working with divs and containers.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Text Editing Optimization:</strong> Refine text editing tools to address font size and spacing issues.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Faster Code Editing:</strong> Optimize code editing performance on single pages.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Improved Visual Feedback:</strong> Enhance visual feedback for drag-and-drop actions and text size adjustments.</p></li></ul></div></section>",,,USER_VALIDATED,In progress,https://product.cycle.app/app/webflow/doc/RG9jXzBlYzJkZTc2LWFlNDMtNGY2Mi05MWJmLWYwNWY4Y2NkMjg0Yg==,CYCLE,,,,,,,,,,,22,,,,alexander@cycle.app,2025-03-27T23:34:44.790Z,,,,,Designer Tools & Features

However, as the hours pass and the project becomes more complex, the first signs of trouble appear. The interface starts to feel sluggish, and the once seamless experience begins to falter.

9655fc77-fcf9-4c31-b832-63253a8214c5,2483,Problem,Development Knowledge Requirement,"<section data-type=""summary""><div><h1>A day in the life of a struggling customer</h1><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the sun rises, our customer, Alex, begins their day with a sense of determination. They are eager to dive into Webflow, a platform they believe holds the key to their web design aspirations. However, as they sip their morning coffee and open the application, a wave of confusion washes over them. The interface, though visually appealing, feels like a labyrinth of unfamiliar terms and concepts. Alex, who comes from a purely visual design background, finds themselves grappling with the intricacies of CSS and HTML. The promise of a no-code experience seems distant, as each click reveals another layer of complexity that requires a developer&apos;s mindset.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, Alex&apos;s initial enthusiasm gives way to frustration. They spend hours watching tutorials and reading documentation, trying to bridge the gap between their design skills and the technical knowledge required to fully utilize Webflow&apos;s capabilities. The learning curve feels steep, and the lack of transparency about the platform&apos;s coding requirements adds to their growing sense of inadequacy. By evening, Alex is mentally exhausted, having spent more time troubleshooting than creating. The dream of effortlessly designing a responsive website remains just that—a dream. As they close their laptop, Alex is left pondering whether they need to invest in coding courses or seek a different tool that aligns better with their skill set.</p><h1>Pain-to-Feature</h1><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The current challenge with Webflow is the perceived necessity for users to have a foundational understanding of coding, particularly HTML and CSS, to effectively utilize the platform. This requirement creates a barrier for users from non-developer backgrounds, leading to a steep learning curve and potential frustration. To address this issue, we propose the following features:</p><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Enhanced Onboarding Experience:</strong> Develop an interactive onboarding tutorial that guides users through the basics of Webflow without assuming prior coding knowledge. This could include step-by-step walkthroughs and visual aids.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>No-Code Design Templates:</strong> Introduce a library of pre-designed, customizable templates that require minimal coding knowledge, allowing users to create professional websites with ease.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>AI-Powered Design Assistance:</strong> Implement AI tools that suggest design improvements and automatically generate code snippets based on user input, reducing the need for manual coding.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Comprehensive Learning Resources:</strong> Expand the existing educational content with beginner-friendly tutorials, webinars, and documentation focused on non-coding users.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Visual CSS Editor:</strong> Create a more intuitive, visual CSS editor that allows users to style elements without writing code, using drag-and-drop functionality and real-time previews.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Community Support and Mentorship:</strong> Establish a mentorship program within the Webflow community where experienced users can guide newcomers through the platform&apos;s features and best practices.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Responsive Design Simplification:</strong> Simplify the process of creating responsive designs by providing pre-configured responsive settings and visual tools to adjust layouts for different devices.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Transparent No-Code Communication:</strong> Clearly communicate the no-code capabilities and limitations of Webflow to set accurate user expectations and reduce confusion.</p></li></ul><p class=""editor-paragraph"">By implementing these features, Webflow can become more accessible to users without a coding background, enhancing the overall user experience and expanding its user base.</p></div></section>",,,AI_CREATED,To do,https://product.cycle.app/app/webflow/doc/RG9jXzk2NTVmYzc3LWZjZjktNGMzMS1iODMyLTYzMjUzYTgyMTRjNQ==,CYCLE,,,,,,,,,,,17,,,,alexander@cycle.app,2025-03-27T23:34:40.499Z,,,,,Designer Tools & Features

The designer is well aware that Webflow&apos;s platform requires hosting on their servers, which limits flexibility and control. This constraint becomes a significant hurdle, as the designer must now navigate the complexities of exporting the project, especially when dealing with CMS-powered sites or dynamic content. The process is cumbersome and time-consuming, leaving the designer feeling constrained and anxious about meeting the client&apos;s expectations.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, the designer juggles multiple tasks, but the issue of hosting remains a persistent thorn in their side.

Alex thinks, &quot;If only I could have more control without needing to code.&quot;</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, Alex faces another challenge: the need for a middle ground between <strong>editor level and designer level access</strong>. The inability to restrict designer-level access to certain pages means that Alex has to spend extra time managing permissions manually. This inefficiency leads to rising frustration and a sense of being stuck in a loop of repetitive tasks.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">By the end of the day, Alex feels drained and unproductive, knowing that these limitations are costing not just time but also potential revenue. The need for more <strong>granular control</strong> is clear, and Alex hopes for a solution that empowers users to design with precision and ease.</p></div></section><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Provides users with more granular control over specific sections of their website, even without code expertise.</p>",,,,To prioritize,https://product.cycle.app/app/webflow/doc/RG9jX2NkYzk5MTdkLTNhMzEtNGFiMC04MjFhLWJkZTRmM2JkMWI4Mg==,CYCLE,,,,,,,Medium,,,,2,,,,alexander@cycle.app,2025-03-26T22:50:58.335Z,,,,,Designer Tools & Features

","<section data-type=""summary""><div><h1>A day in the life of a struggling customer</h1><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the sun rises, the day begins for a dedicated web designer who relies heavily on Webflow to create stunning, responsive websites. The morning is filled with anticipation as they prepare to integrate various third-party applications to enhance their client&apos;s site. However, the excitement quickly turns to frustration as they encounter limitations in Webflow&apos;s current integration capabilities. The lack of seamless connections with essential tools like Zapier and Make means they must spend precious hours manually configuring settings, which disrupts their workflow and delays project timelines. The absence of robust integration with CRM systems further complicates their efforts to automate lead management, leaving them feeling overwhelmed and under-resourced.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, the designer juggles multiple marketing tools, each requiring separate attention due to the lack of cohesive integration within Webflow. The afternoon is marked by a sense of inefficiency as they struggle to sync data across platforms, leading to inconsistent segmentation and missed opportunities for personalized messaging. The inability to export code that works seamlessly with prebuilt systems adds another layer of complexity, forcing them to consider alternative platforms like Shopify for e-commerce solutions. By evening, the designer is exhausted, having spent the day navigating around these integration challenges, and they yearn for a more streamlined experience that would allow them to focus on creativity rather than technical hurdles.</p><h1>Release Note: Expanded Third-Party Integrations</h1><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Welcome to a new era of connectivity with Webflow&apos;s <strong>Expanded Third-Party Integrations</strong>. We&apos;ve listened to your needs and are thrilled to announce a feature that opens the door to seamless integration with a multitude of platforms.

Imagine effortlessly syncing data, optimizing your marketing strategies, and unifying your digital ecosystem. It&apos;s time to elevate your web design experience and unlock new possibilities.

Feedback from various stakeholders indicates that users are seeking a more intuitive, flexible, and advanced drag-and-drop feature. This includes the ability to easily add components into component slots in Build mode, and a more user-friendly interface for moving items within containers.</p><h2>Feature Description</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The Drag-and-Drop Enhancement feature aims to address these concerns by revamping the existing drag-and-drop functionality. This enhancement will provide users with a more advanced and intuitive interface, allowing them to easily move and manage items within containers and add components into component slots in Build mode. The feature will also incorporate no-code features for designing separate landing pages, providing users with more freedom and flexibility in their page building process.</p><h2>Expected Benefits</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The enhancement of the drag-and-drop feature is expected to significantly improve the user experience in the Page Building product area. It will simplify the process of building and customizing web pages, making it more efficient and less time-consuming. This will also empower users with less technical expertise to create and manage their web pages, thereby broadening the user base. Ultimately, this feature enhancement is expected to increase user satisfaction and retention, and potentially attract new users to our platform.</p><h1>Customer Feedback Summary for Drag-and-Drop Enhancement</h1><h2>Feedback on Current Drag-and-Drop Functionality</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Several customers expressed a desire for improvements to the current drag-and-drop functionality. They found the existing interface to be less intuitive and more complex than necessary.</p><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;The drag-and-drop capability could be improved.&quot; - Kylie D., Spotify</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;I would like to have the ability to move products within containers using a &apos;dragging&apos; function instead of the Adobe Illustrator-esque UI.&quot; - Haley K., Relex Solutions</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;I really wish I was able to move items within containers using a &apos;dragging&apos; function instead of the Adobe Illustrator-esque UI.&quot; - Karen G., Google</p></li></ul><h2>Feedback on Component Slots</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Some customers highlighted issues with adding components into component slots in the build mode, indicating a need for enhancement in this area.</p><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;In Build mode, it&apos;s not possible to add Components into Component Slots.&quot; - BTCM, Salesforce</p></li></ul><h2>Feedback on No-Code Features</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Customers also expressed a desire for no-code features for designing separate landing pages, suggesting a potential area for expansion of the drag-and-drop functionality.</p><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;No-code features for fancy separate landing page design.&quot; - VITM, Netlify</p></li></ul><h2>Feedback on Ease of Use</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph"">A few customers appreciated the simplicity of the drag-and-drop feature, indicating that the ease of use is a valuable aspect to retain during enhancement.</p><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;Easy drag and drop feature.&quot; - Sonali K., Airbnb</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;Drag and drop feature for developing websites.

By enabling users to easily move components within containers and add components into slots, we anticipate an increase in user engagement and a decrease in time spent on page design. This could potentially lead to a 15-20% increase in the number of pages built per user, per week.</p><h3>Risks of Inaction</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Ignoring the feedback from our stakeholders could lead to a decrease in user satisfaction and potentially a loss of users to competitors who offer more intuitive page building tools. This could result in a 10-15% decrease in active users and a corresponding decrease in revenue. Furthermore, the lack of this enhancement could hinder the adoption of our product by new users who value ease-of-use and efficiency in their page building tools.</p><h3>Validation Summary</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The need for a drag-and-drop enhancement is strongly validated by direct feedback from our stakeholders. Users from diverse companies such as Spotify, Salesforce, Netlify, Airbnb, Relex Solutions, Zoominfo, Google, and EY have all expressed a desire for improved drag-and-drop functionality. Their feedback highlights the importance of this feature in facilitating efficient and flexible web page design. By addressing this need, we can improve our product&apos;s competitive edge and user satisfaction, ultimately driving business growth.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph""></p>",,,USER_VALIDATED,In progress,https://product.cycle.app/app/webflow/doc/RG9jXzhjM2Q3MTI0LTAxNjMtNDFmNi1hYjNmLWQ1Y2IyNGI1MmYwYg==,CYCLE,,,,,,,Strong,,,https://cycle-team-jyv0lhfx.atlassian.net/browse/SUP-1?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiZmUxNzlmOGFhZTM0NDZmNTlhMDhjNDI1NzYwMTVlMmIiLCJwIjoiaiJ9,6,,,,alexander@cycle.app,2025-03-26T22:50:43.554Z,Collaboration improvement,Wed May 07 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,https://linear.app/webflow-integration/issue/WEB-10/drag-and-drop-on-building-page,Page Building

","<h1>Simultaneous Designer Access</h1><h2>Product Area: Designer Tools &amp; Features</h2><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Description: Provides a suite of tools for designing and building websites, including AI assistance, variable modes, component styling, and animation support.</p><h2>Feature Overview</h2><h3>Problem Statement</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">In the current state of our Designer Tools &amp; Features, collaboration is limited. Stakeholders have expressed a need for more collaborative features, specifically the ability for multiple designers to work on different pages of a site simultaneously. This limitation hinders the efficiency of design teams, as only one person can have full editing functions at a time.</p><h3>Feature Description</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The Simultaneous Designer Access feature addresses this problem by allowing multiple designers to work on different pages of a site at the same time. This feature enhances the collaborative aspect of our Designer Tools &amp; Features, enabling teams to work together more effectively and efficiently.</p><h3>Expected Benefits</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">By implementing the Simultaneous Designer Access feature, we expect to see several benefits:</p><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Increased Efficiency:</strong> Teams can work on different parts of a website simultaneously, reducing the overall time spent on a project.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> With the ability to work together in real-time, teams can communicate and make decisions more effectively.</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph""><strong>Improved User Experience:</strong> By addressing the feedback from our stakeholders, we are improving the overall user experience of our Designer Tools &amp; Features.</p></li></ul><p class=""editor-paragraph"">This feature aligns with our commitment to providing a suite of tools that not only assist in designing and building websites but also promote collaboration and efficiency among design teams.</p><h2>Customer Feedback Summary</h2><h3>Customer Feedback Summary for Simultaneous Designer Access</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">This section aggregates key customer quotes and insights that support the value of the &quot;Simultaneous Designer Access&quot; feature in our Designer Tools &amp; Features product area.</p><h3>Categorized Quotes</h3><h4>Collaboration</h4><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;It would be nice to have more collaborative features or places to leave notes/comments for future iterations.&quot; - Julia A., Amazon</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;Please allow collaboration.&quot; - Priyanka K., Zoom</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;Missing the collaborative aspect on Designer. We need to have multiple people to work on a single website at the same moment.&quot; - Roberto T., Calendly</p></li></ul><h4>Simultaneous Access</h4><ul><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;Allowing multiple designers to be in the program simultaneously.&quot; - Susan Garcia, Shift</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;Only 1 person can have full editing functions as opposed to allowing multiple people to edit the same website at the same time.&quot; - Cristina P., Microsoft</p></li><li><p class=""editor-paragraph"">&quot;To only have one designer spot per site so we can modify different pages at once.&quot; - Thomas Martinez, Microsoft</p></li></ul><h3>Recurring Themes</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The recurring themes from the customer feedback are the need for more collaboration and the ability for multiple designers to have simultaneous access to the design tool. Customers are looking for a more collaborative environment where multiple designers can work on different pages of a site at the same time.</p><h3>Frequency of Comments</h3><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The need for collaboration and simultaneous access was mentioned in all six pieces of feedback received, indicating a strong demand for this feature among our customers.</p><h2>Business Impact &amp; Validation</h2><h3>Simultaneous Designer Access</h3><h4>Impact Metrics</h4><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The introduction of the Simultaneous Designer Access feature in our Designer Tools &amp; Features suite will significantly enhance the productivity and efficiency of our users. By enabling multiple designers to work on different pages of a site simultaneously, we can reduce the time taken to design and build a website. This feature will also foster a more collaborative environment, allowing teams to work together seamlessly and in real-time.</p><h4>Risks of Inaction</h4><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Without the implementation of the Simultaneous Designer Access feature, we risk falling behind our competitors who may already offer similar collaborative features. Our users may find our tools less efficient and less conducive to team collaboration, which could lead to a decrease in user satisfaction and potentially a loss of users to competing platforms.</p><h4>Overall Validation</h4><p class=""editor-paragraph"">The need for this feature is strongly validated by direct feedback from our users. Julia from Amazon expressed a desire for more collaborative features and places to leave notes or comments for future iterations. Susan from Shift.com and Priyanka from Zoom.us both explicitly requested the ability for multiple designers to work in the program simultaneously. Roberto from Calendly.com and Cristina and Thomas from Microsoft.com also highlighted the need for multiple people to be able to work on a single website at the same time.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">In conclusion, the Simultaneous Designer Access feature is not only a valuable addition to our Designer Tools &amp; Features suite but also a necessary one to stay competitive and meet our users&apos; needs. The implementation of this feature will have a positive impact on our business by increasing user satisfaction, fostering collaboration, and ultimately, retaining and attracting more users.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">Allows multiple designers to work on different pages of a site simultaneously.</p>",,,,To prioritize,https://product.cycle.app/app/webflow/doc/RG9jXzY1ZWQzYTE2LTE1MWQtNGFlYi05ZmRjLTZkODdmOWY2MDdlYw==,CYCLE,,,,,,,,,,,6,,,,alexander@cycle.app,2025-03-26T22:50:33.133Z,,,,,Designer Tools & Features

The morning is filled with anticipation as they prepare to update their online store with new digital products. However, the excitement quickly turns to frustration when they realize that uploading these products directly within Webflow is not possible. Instead, they must navigate the cumbersome process of integrating third-party tools, which consumes valuable time and energy. The lack of a standard e-commerce offering within Webflow leaves them feeling constrained and longing for a more seamless experience.</p><p class=""editor-paragraph"">As the day progresses, the challenges continue to mount. The designer attempts to update their CMS collections, only to be hindered by the 10k CMS item limit. This limitation forces them to make difficult decisions about which content to prioritize, adding stress to their already busy schedule. The absence of basic CMS features, such as modifying the publishing date on a post, further complicates their workflow. By evening, the designer is exhausted, having spent the day wrestling with the platform&apos;s limitations instead of focusing on creative tasks. The need for more robust e-commerce and CMS capabilities is clear, leaving them hopeful for future improvements that will better support their business needs.</p><h1>Release Note: Improved E-commerce Functionality</h1><p class=""editor-paragraph"">We&apos;re thrilled to announce a major enhancement to Webflow&apos;s e-commerce capabilities, designed to empower your online business like never before.

The thought of having baked-in SEO features, like autogenerated sitemaps and dynamic meta tags, seems like a distant dream. As the day draws to a close, she reflects on the missed opportunities and the inefficiencies that have plagued her efforts.
